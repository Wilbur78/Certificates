# Certificates & Current Learning Commitments
Tracking my learning progress as I transition into the fields of Deep Learning and Data Analytics. 

More projects from the last couple of months will be uploaded in the coming weeks. You will also be able to find some of these projects in the 'Portfolio' section on my website in the near future (www.willhardy.co) [COMING SOON].

To date, I have finished the following courses since late December, 2022:
1) Zero to Mastery (ZTM) AI & Data Science Bootcamp
2) ZTM TensorFlow Developer Certificate
3) Deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Developer (Finished February 2023)
4) Deeplearning.ai's Deep Learning Specialization with Andrew Ng (Finished March 2023)

In addition to the Deeplearning.ai Specialization, I am also regularly engaged in the following:
- Rounding out my Python skills with the ZTM Complete Python Developer in 2023 course
- Pursuing AWS Solutions Architect Certification through Datacumulus (with Stephane Maarek)
